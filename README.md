A Mechanical Engineering Undergrad by day, Machine Learning geek by night. Ambitious and creative professional with a knack for intuitively grasping the intricacies of challenging problems and coming up with unique solutions. Efficient team player with skills and experience to lead teams and bring about desirable results.


I work in the fields of Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Neural Networks, Computer Vision, and Robotics - talk about a mouthful! Though, I am quite fascinated by all things tech, and, it's power to bring about social good for communities.
